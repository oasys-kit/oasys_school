# First Oasys School

Dates (tentative)
=================

15-17 May 2019


Scope
=====
The first OASYS course will be a hands-on meeting to exploit the posibilities of the different tools in the OASYS suite. They perform calculations for synchrotron radiation beamlines and associated instruments. It will cover the calculations of the power and flux emitted by the different synchrotron sources, the simulation of complete beamlines using ray tracing and wavefront methods, and the automation of the simulations using python-scripts. It will conclude with a code camp to program new OASYS add-ons and applications. 

Audience is typically composed scientists, engineers, technicians, or managers who wish to learn more about simulations in x-ray optics applied to synchrotron instrumentation. In particular they will learn to understand and compute the characteristics of a synchrotron beam, simulate the optical performance of a beamline, and apply new tools to simulate partial coherent beams. 

LEARNING OUTCOMES
=================

This course will enable you to:

- describe/import the beamline elements in terms of the SYNED containers
- Calculate power and flux emitted by synchrotron (white) sources and affecting the optical elements
- Combine the role of rays and wavefronts to describe synchrotron radiation by ray tracing and wavefront propagation. Be familiar with SHADOW, WOFRY and SRW.
- Quantify the beam characteristics (flux, dimensions, intensity profiles) and in optical images from geometrical and synchrotron sources
- Transfer coherence into and throughout optical systems using Monte Carlo methods (SRW) and coherence mode decomposition (COMSYL). 
- Automize tasks and perform long calculations using python scripts. 
- Learn how to extend OASYS functionality writing new widges and new applications. 


COURSE LENGTH
=============

The full course is in three days with possibility to follow one, two or three days. The first day covers simulations of source emission (power and flux) and an introduction to simulate a beamline with ray tracing. Day 2 is dedicated to simulate optical systems with wave optics (for coherent light). The Day 3 is a code camp to develop new applications in OASYS. 


Course assistants: Juan Reyes, Rafael Celestre, Thibault Vallois. 


PROGRAMME
=========

Day 1
-----

This first session is dedicated to calculate the flux and power emitted by synchrotron sources and simulate the beamline elements with ray tracing. 

- Source emission (flux and power)  using XOPPY

- Ray tracing a beamline with ShadowOui

Day 2
-----

This second day will be dedicated to simulate optical systems and also a beamline using wave optics methods

- Combining ray tracing and wave optics with the HYBRID method

- Describe simple systems showing interference and diffraction using WOFRY

- Simulating a complete beamline with SRW

- Introduce methods for partial coherence: Monte Carlo multi-electron analysis with COMSYL, and coherence mode decomposition with COMSYL. 

Day 3
-----

This third day will is a full-day code camp for learning how to create new OASYS widgets and add-ons. It will also serve as a platform for learning how to automize tasks making parametric calculations and perform long runs using scripts that run in a cluster.
