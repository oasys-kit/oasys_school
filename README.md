Scope
=====
OASYS is a software environment that permits to simulate a complete synchrotron beamline.

Description
===========

Course contents, detailing items such as an overview of the course topic, the problems it can solve, and examples of applications for the technology or approach. Audience is typically composed of professional engineers rather than researchers. 

LEARNING OUTCOMES
=================

This course will enable you to:

- describe the beamline in terma of the SYNED containers
- Calculate power and flux emitted by synchrotron sources
- Explain the role of rays, and wavefronts to describe synchrotron radiation by ray tracing
- Quantify the flux and in optical images from point and extended sources
- Transfer radiant energy into and throughout optical systems
- be familiar with SHADOW and SRW 

INTENDED AUDIENCE
=================

Scientists, engineers, technicians, or managers who wish to learn more about simulations in x-ray optics applied to synchrotron instrumentation

COURSE LEVEL
============

Intermediate

COURSE LENGTH
=============

The full course is in three days with possibility to follow one, two or three days. The first day covers simulations of source emission (power and flux) and an introduction to simulate a beamline with ray tracing. The day 2 is dedicated to simulate optical systems with wave optics (for coherent light). The Day 3 is a code camp to develop new applications in OASYS. 

INSTRUCTORS
===========

M Sanchez del Rio, Luca Rebuffi

Course assistants: Juan Reyes, Rafael Celestre, Thibault Vallois. 


PROGRAMME
=========

Day 1
-----

This first session is dedicated to calculate the flux and power emitted by synchrotron sources and simulate the beamline elements with ray tracing.

- Ray tracing a beamline with ShadowOui

Day 2
-----

This second day will be dedicated to simulate optical systems and also a beamline using wave optics methods

- Overview of wave optics applications. Simple systems with WOFRY

- Simulating a complete beamline with SRW

Day 3
-----

This third day will is a full-day code camp for learning how to create new OASYS widgets and add-ons.
